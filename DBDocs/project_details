Background of the problem statement:

Learnerâ€™s Academy is a school that has an online management system. The system keeps track of its classes, subjects, students, and teachers. It has a back-office application with a single administrator login. The administrator can:

    Set up a master list of all the subjects for all the classes
    Set up a master list of all the teachers
    Set up a master list of all the classes
    Assign classes for subjects from the master list
    Assign teachers to a class for a subject (A teacher can be assigned to different classes for different subjects)
    Get a master list of students (Each student must be assigned to a single class)

There will be an option to view a Class Report which will show all the information about the class, such as the list of students, subjects, and teachers

The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible.
